# UUIDs-generator

Hello!
I tried to extend the assignment and make the final solution a little more comprehensive than just implementing the get_id function :)
So the idea was to design the nodes system as a class that contains some data members which are relevant to our challenge.

- The node.h file contains the Node class definition which models the "template" that helps us define each one of the 1024 system nodes;
- The node.cpp file contains the implementantions of the class methods (this is where the get_id implementation is found)
- The main.cpp file contains details such as creating the nodes environment, functions that emulate callers requesting the desire UUIDs and a suite of tests that show how all the elements work intertwined.
I provided complete details about each element in the program inside the files!
